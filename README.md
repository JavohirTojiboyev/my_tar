## Task
TODO - What is the problem? And where is the challenge?

## Description
I did this project in less than two days. The goal of this project was to discover how the archiver and compresser tar works.

To do so we concatenate all the files and repository in one archive file separate by official tar headers. Then we compresse this archive with the zlib.


## Installation
TODO - How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
